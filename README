This package contains the source code accompanying the paper

Falk Hüffner, Sebastian Wernicke, and Thomas Zichner:
Algorithm engineering for color-coding to facilitate signaling pathway
detection. In Proceedings of the 5th Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics
Conference (APBC'07), Hong Kong. January 2007. Advances in
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, World Scientific.

And it contains a user-friendly graphical tool named FASPAD to detect
signaling pathway candidates in protein interaction networks. This 
tool is based on the command line program belonging to the paper.

Command line program
====================

It can solve two problems (see paper):

* Find minimum-weight paths of a prespecified length in a weighted
  undirected graph.
* Path queries.

The program is written in ISO C++. It has only been tested on Unix
systems, but should be portable to other systems. Sources can be
obtained at http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/colorcoding/. They
are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL, see COPYING).

It has been tested on:

* Debian GNU/Linux (i386) 3.1 with GNU g++ 3.3.5, 3.4.4, and 4.1.0
* Digital Unix 5.1 (Alpha) with GNU g++ 3.3.2 and DEC C++ V6.3-008
  (needs the "-std strict_ansi" option)
* Solaris 9 (UltraSPARC) with GNU g++ 4.0.2
* Windows XP/Cygwin 1.4

If you have the "make" utility (as any Unix system has), you can
compile with "make".

The program is called "colorcoding". By default, it reads a graph from
standard input and writes the paths found to standard output. The
graph format is a simple text format, where each line describes one
edge, given by its two endpoints and the edge weight separated by
whitespace:

v0 v1 0.32
v1 v2 1.22
v2 v0 0.01

Vertex names can be any combination of letters, digits, and _. Note
that this graph format cannot describe degree-0 vertices; however,
they are irrelevant for finding paths anyway.

The output is a set of (by default 100) paths of minimum weight in the
graph. Each line describes one path by giving its total weight and the
list of vertices. Example:

# ./colorcoding < example.graph 
1.73 10 3 5 4 7 2 1 6

There are many options that affect program behavior; see ./colorcoding -h
for a listing.

FASPAD
======

It can solve two problems:

* Detect signaling pathway candidates in protein interaction
  networks.
* Find minimum-weight paths of a prespecified length in a weighted
  undirected graph.

The current version can be obtained at 
http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/faspad/. It is distributed 
under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL, see COPYING).

The program is written in ISO C++, using the wxWidgets library. 
Therefore it is portable to different platforms like Unix systems,
Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS.
To build the program, you need the wxWidgets library (version 2.6 or
newer), the Graphviz library (version 2.8 or newer), the GNU gcc 
compiler (version 3.2 or newer) and GNU make.
If you want to build FASPAD under Microsoft Windows you also need 
Cygwin (version 1.5 or newer) or MinGW (version 3.3 or newer).

It has been tested on:

* Debian GNU/Linux (i386) 3.1 with GNU g++ 3.3.5, wxWidgets 2.8 and 
  Graphviz 2.8
* Windows XP with MinGW 3.3, wxWidgets 2.6 and Graphviz 2.12

If you have the "make" utility (as any Unix system has), you can
compile with "make". You have to execute it in the directory gui.
There are two additional makefiles.
"Makefile.static" which can be used to link the wxWidgets and Graphviz 
libraries statically, and "Makefile.win" to build FASPAD under Windows.
But since they contain absolute file paths, you have to adapt them to 
your system.

The program is called "faspad" respectively "faspad.exe". 
How to use the program is descriped in the manual which can be obtained 
at the http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/faspad/. Test data (the 
protein interaction networks of yeast and drosophila) can also be 
obtained at the FASPAD web page.
