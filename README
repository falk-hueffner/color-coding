Command line program
====================

It can solve two problems (see paper):

* Find minimum-weight paths of a prespecified length in a weighted
  undirected graph.
* Path queries.

The program is written in ISO C++. It has only been tested on Unix
systems, but should be portable to other systems. Sources can be
obtained at http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/colorcoding/. They
are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL, see COPYING).

It has been tested on:

* Debian GNU/Linux (x86-64) with GNU g++ 4.3.5 and 4.4.5

Previous versions have been tested on:

* Debian GNU/Linux (i386) 3.1 with GNU g++ 3.3.5, 3.4.4, and 4.1.0
* Digital Unix 5.1 (Alpha) with GNU g++ 3.3.2 and DEC C++ V6.3-008
  (needs the "-std strict_ansi" option)
* Solaris 9 (UltraSPARC) with GNU g++ 4.0.2
* Windows XP/Cygwin 1.4

If you have the "make" utility (as any Unix system has), you can
compile with "make".

The program is called "colorcoding". By default, it reads a graph from
standard input and writes the paths found to standard output. The
graph format is a simple text format, where each line describes one
edge, given by its two endpoints and the edge weight separated by
whitespace:

v0 v1 0.32
v1 v2 1.22
v2 v0 0.01

Vertex names can be any combination of letters, digits, and _. Note
that this graph format cannot describe degree-0 vertices; however,
they are irrelevant for finding paths anyway.

The output is a set of (by default 100) paths of minimum weight in the
graph. Each line describes one path by giving its total weight and the
list of vertices. Example:

# ./colorcoding < example.graph 
1.73 10 3 5 4 7 2 1 6

There are many options that affect program behavior; see ./colorcoding -h
for a listing.
